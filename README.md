### 📋 Using the documentation

The documentation is organized into directories, with each representing its own
distinctive modules. Within each module's directory, Markdown files document
details including function signatures, and relevant information. Data structures
and enumerated values are also documented where relevant in their respective
module directories.

Documentation is also provided within header files itself within the code's
`include/` directory. Such documentation comments can be viewed as a *"quick
reference"* and specifically aids in integration of documentation with IDE or
code editors, however, more details would always be provided in this repository.
