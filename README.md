Welcome to the documentation site for the Jas Assembler. Please note that no source code is stored here in this repository, please visit the main repository [here](https://github.com/cheng-alvin/jas) for the complete corresponding source code that this documentation repository is based upon.

### 📋 Using the documentation 
The Jas documentation files are organised into the `examples/`, and `ref/` directories. The `examples/` directory provides examples on how a combination of Jas functions and modules can be used together in small toy-grade projects; the `ref/` directory contains documentation files with further details in the usage and implementation of Jas assembler functions.

Documentation is also provided within header files itself, in the source code's [`include/`](https://github.com/cheng-alvin/jas/tree/main/libjas/include) directory. Such documentation comments can be used as a *"quick reference"* and aids in integration of documentation with IDE or code editors, however, more detais would always be provided by the `ref/` directory.
