Welcome to the documentation site for the Jas Assembler. Please note that no
source code is stored here in this repository, please visit the main repository
[here](https://github.com/cheng-alvin/jas) for the complete corresponding source
code that this documentation repository is based upon.

### 📋 Using the documentation

The documentation is organized into directories, with each representing its own
distinctive modules. Within each module's directory, Markdown files document
details including function signatures, and relevant information. Data structures
and enumerated values are also documented where relevant in their respective
module directories.

Documentation is also provided within header files itself within the code's
`include/` directory. Such documentation comments can be viewed as a *"quick
reference"* and specifically aids in integration of documentation with IDE or
code editors, however, more details would always be provided in this repository.

### 📖 Obtaining documentation

Since the entirety of the Jas documentation is written and actively maintained
Markdown, The documentation can be viewed through the default Github file
explorer, or any other supported applications. Formatting of the raw source
files are done to support access of the documentation via traditional text
editors without rendering Markdown. The documentation files may be obtained by
pulling the current repository link or through:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cheng-alvin/jas-doc/
```
