### 📋 Using the documentation 
The documentation is organised into directories, with each representing its own distinctive modules. Within each module's directory, Markdown files document details including function signatures, and relavant information. Data structures and enumerated values are also documented where relavant in their respective module directories. 

Documentation is also provided within header files itself, in the source code's [`include/`](https://github.com/cheng-alvin/jas/tree/main/libjas/include) directory. Such documentation comments can be used as a *"quick reference"* and aids in integration of documentation with IDE or code editors, however, more detais would always be provided in this repository.
